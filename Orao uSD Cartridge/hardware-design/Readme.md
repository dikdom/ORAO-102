# HW files
These are the hardware design files. You can reproduce your own cart by using the schematics of the
cart. 
If you OK with the major flaws of my cart I created for myself you can even re-order a batch for 
yourself also. Be warned, this edge connector is not compatible or with the original either with the
Orao 2007 board. None of them.
